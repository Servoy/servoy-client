/**
 * The <code>JSRenderEvent</code> class represents rendering callbacks for UI elements, providing context about the rendering process.
 * It includes methods to retrieve the rendered element, its associated record, and additional state such as focus, selection, and index.
 *
 * The rendered element is accessed through <code>getRenderable</code>, returning a scriptable representation of the UI element.
 * Developers can obtain the record tied to the rendered element, although it may be null in certain cases like table view modes.
 * State information includes whether the element has focus, its selection status, and its record index, enabling dynamic adjustments during rendering.
