/**
 * <p>The <code>RuntimeContainer</code> class is designed to manage the styling of a container in a dynamic environment.
 * One of its primary functions is to modify the visual appearance of the container by adding or removing style classes.
 * This functionality allows for flexibility in managing the containerâ€™s style dynamically during runtime.</p>
 *
 * <p>Additionally, the class provides methods to check for specific set of style classes in the container.
 * This can be particularly useful for making conditional styling decisions based on the container's current style state.</p>
 *
 * <p>For more granular control over the container's appearance, the <code>setCSSStyle()</code> and <code>removeCSSStyle()</code> methods may be used.</p>
