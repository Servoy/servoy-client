/**
 * Components which wants to update themselfs with an ajax call should implement this interface.
 * <p>
 * It has a {@link #setChanged()} method for marking the component for render.
 * when calling {@link #setChanged()} on it the component will be re rendered the next time a (ajax) request comes in
 * This can be the ajax polling behavior that every page of a servoy application has if ajax mode is enabled.
 * </p>
 * When setChanged() is called you have to call {@link #setRendered()} when the component is rendered again
 * else it will be re rendered for every coming request. This can be done by calling {@link #setRendered()} from the {@link Component#onAfterRender()}
 * that the wicket component needs to override.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Try to use the the implementation class {@link com.servoy.j2db.server.headlessclient.dataui.ChangesRecorder}
 * this interface can change with new Servoy versions if new functionality is needed.
 * </p>
