	 * Make sure the operator and the data (value) are part of the string passed to dataprovider (included inside a pair of quotation marks).
	 * Note: always make sure to check the result of the find() method.
	 *
	 * When in find mode, columns can be assigned string expressions (including operators) that are evaluated as:
	 * General:
	 *       c1||c2    (condition1 or condition2)
	 *       c|format  (apply format on condition like 'x|dd-MM-yyyy')

	 *       x...y     (between values x and y, including values)
	 *       x         (equals value x)
	 *
	 *  Number fields:
	 *       =x       (equals value x)
	 *       ^=       (is null or zero)
	 *
	 *  Date fields:
	 *       #c       (equals value x, entire day)

	 *       //       (equals today)
	 *       today    (equals today)

	 * Related columns can be assigned, they will result in related searches.
	 * For example, "employees_to_department.location_id = headoffice" finds all employees in the specified location).
	 *
	 * Searching on related aggregates is supported.
	 * For example, "orders_to_details.total_amount = '&gt;1000'" finds all orders with total order details amount more than 1000.
	 *
	 * Arrays can be used for searching a number of values, this will result in an 'IN' condition that will be used in the search.
	 * The values are not restricted to strings but can be any type that matches the column type.
	 * For example, "record.department_id = [1, 33, 99]"
	 *
	 * Multiple Find Records for Logical OR:
	 * It's important to note that when in Find Mode, a foundset will initially contain one record object.
	 * However, multiple record objects may be used to articulate search criteria.
	 * This has the effect that the criteria described in each record are concatenated by a SQL OR.
