/**
 *  This abstract class provides default implementations for most of
 *  the methods in the <code>TableModel</code> interface. It takes care of
 *  the management of listeners and provides some conveniences for generating
 *  <code>TableModelEvents</code> and dispatching them to the listeners.
 *  To create a concrete <code>TableModel</code> as a subclass of
 *  <code>AbstractTableModel</code> you need only provide implementations 
 *  for the following three methods:
 *
 *  <pre>
 *  public int getRowCount();
 *  public Object getValueAt(int row);
 *  </pre>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong>
 * Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 * appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 * the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 * of all JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
 * has been added to the <code>java.beans</code> package.
 * Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}.
